I have processed the projects as listed in
"sample-maven-projects_original.csv". I copied 
"sample-maven-projects_original.csv" to "../sample-maven-projects.csv".
Then, to obtain the projects, "../download.sh" was executed. This 
downloaded all the projects into the "sample-projects" directory.

Then I checked to see which projects built on my machine. I did this by
running "../build.sh". This outputs a CSV with the schema
"<project>,<build_return_code>". Therefore, a "<build_return_code>" of
"0" means the project built sucessfully. It should be noted that some of
the projects crashed during building and this ripples up to crash the
script (I don't know why). Therefore, "build.sh" was executed
several times to fully populate the CSV. Within this directory, the
"build_output.csv" file contains the CSV generated by "../build.sh".

I then processed the built projects to see if all their tests passed. I
dud this via "../tests_pass_script.sh" with a single argument --- the
output of the "../build.sh" (in our case, "build_output.csv"). This
script outputs a CSV with a schema of "<project>,<test_return_code>",
with a "<test_return_code>" of "0" meaning all tests have passed. We
recorded this output CSV to "test_output.csv".

We then ran the following script:

`cat tests_output.csv | awk -F, '($2==0){print $1}' | while read x; do 
	dir=$(echo $(basename ${x}) | cut -d_ -f1)
	dir2=$(echo $(basename ${x}) | cut -d_ -f2)
	echo "https://github.com/${dir}/${dir2}.git" \
	>>compiled_and_working_repos.dat
done`

The generated "compiled_and_working_reports.dat" contains links to
GitHub repos which contain projects that we can compile and that all
tests pass.

We then deleted projects in "../sample-maven-projects.csv" which we
found could not be compiled or contained failing test cases.
