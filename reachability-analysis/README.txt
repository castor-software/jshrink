The best way to build the app is with the following command:

mvn compile -pl jshrink-app -am

The resulting jar can be found in 
"jshrink-app/target/jshrink-app-1.0-SHAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar".

Notes:
- If you want to open this project in an IDE, please ensure that you
copy "jshrink-lib/src/main/resources/poa.properties" to 
"<your home directory>/.tamiflex/poa.properties".
