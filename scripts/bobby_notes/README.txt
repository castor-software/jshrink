I have processed the projects as listed in "sample-maven-projects.csv".
First, to obtain the projects, "download.sh" is executed. This will
download all the projects into the "sample-projects" directory.

Then I check to see which projects build on my machine. I do this by
running "build_2.sh". This outputs a CSV with the schema
"<project>,<build_return_code>". Therefore, a "<build_return_code>" of
"0" means the project built sucessfully. It should be noted that some of
the projects crash during building and this ripples up to crash the
script (I don't know why). Therefore, "build_2.sh" must be executed
several times to fully populate the CSV. Within this directory, the
"build_output.csv" file contains the CSV generated by "build_2.sh".

I then processed the built projects to see if all their tests passed. I
do this via "tests_pass_script.sh" with a single argument --- the
output of the "build_2.sh" (in our case, "build_output.csv"). This
script outputs a CSV with a schema of "<project>,<test_return_code>",
with a "<test_return_code>" of "0" meaning all tests have passed. We
record this output CSV to "test_output.csv".

We then run the following script:

`cat tests_output.csv | awk -F, '($2==0){print $1}' | while read x; do 
	dir=$(echo $(basename ${x}) | cut -d_ -f1)
	dir2=$(echo $(basename ${x}) | cut -d_ -f2)
	echo "https://github.com/${dir}/${dir2}.git" \
	>>compiled_and_working_repos.dat
done`

The generated "compiled_and_working_reports.dat" contains links to
GitHub repos which contain projects that we can compile and that all
tests pass.
